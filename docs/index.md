        <span > &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Engineering Data Scientist </span>
        <span style="float:right;">July 2017 - present</span>
        <span > <br></span>
</div>

*   Developed multiple virtual sensor and digital twin models to provide calculated engineering data sets. These models included empirical machine learning regression models which were trained using test-bed data sets. I developed the pipelines for these models, using `Snowflake` and `Python` for the data processing and `Tableau` and `Python` web-apps for the data visualisation
*   Provided technical support for critical engineering issues through data analysis of large datasets and reporting back to stakeholders. The data was visualised using the `Plotly` and `Matplotlib` plotting libraries
*   Generated several `Python` based web-apps to enable engineers to use novel techniques to visualize very large data sets and to characterise/tag snippets of time-series data. These packages used `Vaex` and `DuckDB` and deployed using either `Jupyter Widgets`/`Voila` or `Dash` 
*   Authored web-app documentation using `mkdocs` and provided formal training for the `Python` packages that I developed
*   Coached and provided technical support for student and graduate engineers and assisted them to deliver many successful projects
*   Significantly contributed to internal process documentation which includes `Python` and `SQL` coding and documentation standards.
*   Supervised sponsored PhD project of Bayesian probabilistic modelling with the objective of transferring an advanced acedemic project into a useful engineering development tool 
*   I was a graduate recruitment team member. This involoved candidate selection and interviewing of potential graduates
